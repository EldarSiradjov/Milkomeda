# MILKOMEDA - Rulebook

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Milkomeda, a strategy game set in a newly merged galaxy! You lead one of the Awakened human factions, competing for resources, territory, and dominance. Explore the galaxy, build fleets and structures, engage in tactical combat, and achieve objectives guided by the mysterious Luminary Warden. Be cunning, be bold, and shape the future!

## 2. GAME OBJECTIVE

Become the most dominant faction by earning the most **Victory Points (VP)**. The game ends when either:

* The last **Sector Card** is explored and placed.
* The last available VP slot on any public **Objective Card** is claimed.

The player with the most VP at the end wins.

## 3. COMPONENTS

* **Sector Cards:** Form the modular game board. Each shows:
  * 4 Resource Values: Blue (Logistic), Orange (Economic), Red (Strategic), Green (Scientific).
  * Sector Name & Keywords (e.g., Biosphere, Warzone - for Objectives).
  * Exploration Cost: Paid in Green resources to place the card.
* **Homeworld Cards:** Special starting Sector cards (1 per player).
* **Fleet Tokens:** 25 per player color (used on the main board).
* **Structure Tokens:** 5 per player (2 Outposts, 1 Starlance, 1 Hypergate, 1 M-Brain).
* **Directive Cards (Decks: Directive 1, Directive 2, Directive 3):** Cards showing resource color patterns to match on the game board. Tiered by pattern difficulty.
* **Protocol Cards (Decks: Protocol 1, Protocol 2, Protocol 3):** Action Modules granting bonus actions when paired Directives are met. Tiered by resource cost.
* **Objective Cards:** Public goals granting VP when achieved.
* **Order Cards:** Determine turn order (Cards 1-N for players + 1 "Master" card).
* **Master of the Order Token:** Indicates the player managing the next round's start phase.
* **Player Components (Per Player):**
  * 1 Civilization Card (unique ability).
  * 1 Storage Card (for tracking resources) & 4 Resource Trackers.
  * 1 Action Display Card & 1 Action Marker (tracks last main action).
  * 1 Player Screen (to hide roster).
  * 1 Fleet Roster Card (for secret combat choices) & 5 Fleet Roster Indicators.
  * Supply of Claim Markers (player color, for Objectives).
  * Set of Dice (player color, d6).
* **Shared Components:**
  * Battle Mat (for resolving combat).
  * Supply of "Marked" Tokens (or use tap/turn convention during combat).

## 4. SETUP

1. **Prepare Central Area:** Leave space for the Sector grid, Battle Mat, and the Directive/Protocol display.
2. **Place Sector Deck:** Shuffle Sector Cards and place face-down.
3. **Public Objectives:** Shuffle Objective Cards. Draw 5 face-up to form the **Public Objectives Row**. Return others to the box.
4. **Directive/Protocol Display (3 Positions):**
    * Create three columns.
    * **Top Row (Draw Decks):** Place shuffled **Directive 1**, **Directive 2**, **Directive 3** decks face-down.
    * **Middle Row (Face-Up Directives):** Draw 1 card from each Directive deck above it and place face-up below the deck (D1 below D1 deck, etc.).
    * **Bottom Row (Face-Up Protocols):** Draw 1 card from **Protocol 3**, **Protocol 2**, **Protocol 1** decks and place face-up below the corresponding Directive (P3 below D1, P2 below D2, P1 below D3).
    * **Lowest Row (Draw Decks):** Place the shuffled **Protocol 3**, **Protocol 2**, **Protocol 1** decks face-down below their corresponding face-up Protocol card.
    * *(This creates 3 pairs: (Directive 1 / Protocol 3), (Directive 2 / Protocol 2), (Directive 3 / Protocol 1)).*
5. **Choose Civilizations:** Each player picks or gets a random Civilization card.
6. **Player Components:** Each player takes their Civilization card, Homeworld, Fleet Tokens, Structure Tokens, Storage Card + Trackers, Action Display + Marker, Player Screen, Fleet Roster + Indicators, Claim Markers, and Dice.
7. **Place Homeworlds:** Players place their Homeworld card in a starting position around the grid area (e.g., corners).
8. **Initial Fleets & Resources:**
    * Place 3 Fleet Tokens on your Homeworld.
    * Set Trackers: **Blue 3, Orange 3, Red 3, Green 5**.
9. **Initial Action Marker:** Place off the side of the Action Display.
10. **Reveal Adjacent Sectors:** Each player draws 2 Sector Cards. Check the total Exploration Cost.
    * If affordable (pay total **Green** cost), place both face-up adjacent to your Homeworld. **Declare orientation** (rotation) for each.
    * If total cost is too high, choose *one* you can afford, pay its **Green** cost, place it adjacent (declare orientation), and shuffle the other back into the deck.
    * Shuffle any unplaced cards back into the Sector Deck.
11. **Place Shared Components:** Put Battle Mat, Order Cards, Master Token, and Marked Tokens nearby.

## 5. CIVILIZATIONS (Example Abilities - Confirm Final List)

* **Stellar Architects:** Megastructures (Starlance, Hypergate, M-Brain) cost 1 less **Orange**.
* **Quantum Sentinels:** Gain 1 **Red** when you initiate an Attack Action.
* **Void Navigators:** Your base Move Action range is 2 sectors instead of 1.
* **Helix Cultivators:** Gain 1 **Green** immediately when you claim an Objective VP slot.

## 6. GAME PLAY OVERVIEW

Players take turns exploring, expanding territory, gathering resources, building forces, and attacking opponents. Matching Directives grants bonus Protocol actions. Earn VP from objectives, control, structures, and resources.

## 7. TURN STRUCTURE

Game proceeds in rounds. Each round:

* **Phase 1: Master of Order & Turn Order:**
    1. **Assign Master:** Player who went last in previous round gets the **Master of the Order Token**. *(First round: Skip step 2. Shuffle Order Cards [Player #s + Master]. Draw 1 each. Lowest # goes first. Player with "Master" card goes last and keeps it.)*
    2. **(Subsequent Rounds Only) Master Adjusts Display:** The Master *must* choose **one Position (1, 2, or 3)** and do **one** of these:
        * **A) Refresh Pair:** Discard both face-up Directive and Protocol. Draw 1 new card from each corresponding draw deck (above/below) to replace them.
        * **B) Refresh Directive:** Discard the face-up Directive. Draw 1 new card from its draw deck above.
        * **C) Refresh Protocol:** Discard the face-up Protocol. Draw 1 new card from its draw deck below.
        * *(If a Draw Deck is empty, shuffle its discard pile to make a new one. If both empty, slot stays empty.)*
    3. **Propose Order:** Master draws *two* Order Cards (player numbers).
    4. **Bribing:** Players may bribe the Master (using Resources) to influence the *display adjustment* (Step 2) AND/OR the *turn order* (Step 5). Bribes are paid immediately.
    5. **Distribute Order:** Master distributes ALL Order Cards (their Master card, the revealed two, the remaining hidden player #s) among all players. Reveal simultaneously. Lowest # acts first, highest # next, player with Master card acts last.
* **Phase 2: Player Actions:** In turn order, each player performs:
    1. **Gain Income:**
        * +3 of each resource (Blue, Orange, Red, Green) from Homeworld.
        * Gain resources shown on each *other* Sector Card you control.
        * Update Storage Card. *(Structure income is handled separately, see Section 12)*
    2. **Choose Main Core Action:** Select **one** (Explore, Move, Build, Attack). You **cannot** choose the same main action you took last turn, unless you control an M-Brain. Place Action Marker on choice.
    3. **Pay Main Action Cost:** Pay action's resource costs (if any). Adjust trackers.
    4. **Perform Main Core Action:** Resolve the action fully.
    5. **(Optional) Check Directives & Activate Protocol:** After resolving the Main Action:
        * **Check Intersections:** Look at **Intersection Points** (where 4 sector corners meet) adjacent to **sectors you control**.
        * **Find Match:** See if the resource colors on the 4 corners match a face-up **Directive Card** (see **Pattern Matching** in Glossary).
        * **Activate (Optional):** If matched, you *may* activate the paired **Protocol Card**:
            * Check: Protocol action *must be different* from your Main Action this turn.
            * Pay Protocol Cost (listed on card, reduced by M-Brain if applicable).
            * Pay normal cost for the Protocol's action (e.g., Green for Explore, Blue/Orange for Build, etc.).
            * Perform Protocol's action fully.
            * **Limit:** Max 1 Protocol activation per turn.
    6. **Note Last Action:** Remember which action (Main or Protocol) was chronologically last for next turn's restriction check.
    7. **(Optional) Check & Claim Objectives:** If you now meet a condition for an unclaimed VP slot on a Public Objective Card, you *may* claim it. Place your Claim Marker.
        * **Limit:** Max 1 claim per turn. Claim immediately or lose the chance for "this turn" objectives.
* **Phase 3: Round End:** After all players act, check game end conditions. If none met, pass Master token to the player who just acted last. Start next round (Phase 1).

## 8. CORE ACTIONS

* **A. EXPLORE**

* **Goal:** Expand your physical territory, gain access to new sectors and resources.
* **Procedure:**
    1. **(Optional Boost):** You may spend **1 Green resource** per additional Sector card you wish to draw this action (decide before drawing).
    2. **Draw:** Draw **2** Sector cards (plus any boosted amount) from the Sector Deck. Reveal them.
    3. **Place:** Select one or more of the revealed Sector cards to place on the map. Place them adjacent to sectors you currently control. You must declare the **orientation** (rotation) of each card as you place it.
    4. **Pay Sector Cost:** For *each* Sector card you placed, pay its individual **Exploration Cost** (the `back_value`) in **Green** resources.
    5. **Cleanup:** Shuffle any revealed Sector cards you chose *not* to place back into the Sector Deck.
    6. **(Game End Check):** If the Sector Deck was emptied during the Draw step, the relevant game end condition is checked after placement and payment are complete.

* **B. RESEARCH**

Alright, here is the **Research** action explained simply, using the system we decided on:

This action lets you gain new Technology cards, which give you special advantages.

1. **Choose Focus:** Look at the types of places (sectors) you control, identified by their keywords (like Biosphere, Extraction, Warzone, etc.). Choose **one** of those keywords to be your research focus for this turn.
2. **Pay Cost:** Pay **4 Green** resources.
3. **Figure Out How Many Cards to Draw:**
    * You *always* get to draw at least **1 card**.
    * **Check 1 (Specialization):** Do you control **two or more** places with the keyword you chose? If YES, you get to draw **+1 extra card**.
    * **Check 2 (Diversity):** Do you control places with **three or more *different*** kinds of keywords *total* across all your territory? If YES, you get to draw **+1 extra card**.
    * *(So, you'll draw 1, 2, or 3 cards total based on those two checks).*
4. **Draw Cards:** Draw the number of cards you calculated from the Tech Deck matching the keyword you chose at the start.
5. **Pick One:** Look at the cards you drew. Choose the **one** you like best.
6. **Keep It:** Place the chosen Tech card face-up in your play area. Its special ability works for you now!
7. **Discard:** Put the Tech cards you didn't choose into their discard pile.

So, Research costs Green, lets you focus on a type of technology linked to your territory, and rewards you with more choices (more cards drawn) if you either specialize in that territory type or have diverse holdings across the map.

* **C. MOVE**
    1. Choose up to 2 sectors you control. Move any number of fleets from there.
    2. Base Range: 1 sector (*Void Navigator base range: 2*).
    3. (Optional) Spend **Blue**: +1 range per Blue spent (applies to all moves this action).
    4. Move into/through enemy sectors freely. Does NOT trigger combat.
    5. Reassess control of destination sector(s) after movement (most fleets wins ties, see Glossary: Control).
    6. *(Hypergate interaction: See Section 12).*

* **D. BUILD**
    1. Choose up to **one** Build option below. Pay combined **Blue** + **Orange** costs as applicable.
    2. **Build Options:**
        * **Build Fleets:** Pay 1 **Orange** per fleet (potentially reduced by Outpost, see Section 12). Place up to 2 Fleets in your Homeworld sector, or in an Outpost sector as specified by Outpost rules.
        * **Build Structure:** Choose a Structure type you are eligible to build (see limits in Section 12). Pay its **Blue** and **Orange** cost (listed in Section 12). Place the Structure token in a controlled sector that doesn't already have your structure of the same type (exception: Outposts). See Section 12 for full details on Structures.

* **E. ATTACK**
    1. Choose **one** Attack option:
        * **Attack Fleets:** Target adjacent sector with opponent fleets.
            * Choose 1 or 2 origin sectors you control.
            * Pay 1 **Blue** per border crossed from each origin to reach target (min 1 Blue total).
            * Move any number of fleets from origin(s) into target. **Initiate Combat** (Section 9).
            * *(Hypergate interaction: See Section 12).*
        * **Target Structure (Requires Starlance):** Perform the special **Target Structure** action detailed under the Starlance entry in Section 12. This is your *entire* Attack Action for the turn.

## 9. COMBAT RULES

Resolves when Attack Action moves fleets into sector with opponent(s). Uses Battle Mat & Fleet Roster.

1. **Participants:** Identify Attacker (initiated attack) & Defender(s). All players with fleets participate.
2. **Secret Fleet Configuration:** All participants go behind Player Screens. Secretly use Fleet Roster Indicators on Fleet Roster Card to assign your fleets in the sector to the 5 Ship Types. Total must match fleets present.
3. **Reveal & Place:** Simultaneously reveal Rosters. Place corresponding fleet tokens onto Ship Type Nodes on Battle Mat. Clear Roster Card.
4. **Determine Dice Pool:** Each player checks Battle Mat. For each node with *your* ships: gain 1 die per outgoing Attack Vector arrow pointing to a node with *enemy* ships. Max 2 dice earned *per node you occupy*. Gather total dice (your color).
5. **Roll Dice:** All players roll their dice pool simultaneously.
6. **Identify Hits:** Each die showing 5 or 6 is a "Hit". Collect your Hits.
7. **Secret Hit Allocation:** Go behind screens again. Look at your Hits total. Secretly use Roster Indicators on Roster Card tracks: Assign your Hits to target specific *enemy ship types* you have valid Attack Vectors against (arrows from your ships pointing to theirs). Total value across indicators must equal your Hits total.
8. **Reveal Allocation:** Simultaneously reveal Rosters showing hit assignments.
9. **Resolve Hits:**
    * **Order:** Attacker resolves all their hits first, then Defenders resolve in player turn order.
    * **Active Player:** For each hit assigned on your Roster to an enemy type (e.g., 2 hits on "Shield Cruiser" track): Choose 1 enemy fleet token *of that type* currently **on its Node** on the Battle Mat. **Physically move** that token into the "Damaged Area" around that node. *You choose which opponent's ship if multiple.* Ships moved here cannot be targeted again *this step*. Repeat for all your hits.
10. **Remove Casualties:** After *all* players finish Step 9, **remove ALL** fleet tokens currently in **any Damaged Area** from the game (return to supply).
11. **End Combat Round?** Check Battle Mat.
    * If >1 player still has fleets: Start new combat round at Step 4 (Determine Dice).
    * If <=1 player has fleets: **Combat Ends.**
12. **Post-Combat Control:** Winning player (last one with fleets) controls the sector. If mutual destruction, sector is uncontrolled (unless Defender had a structure, then they keep control - see Section 12).

## 10. FLEETS & SHIP TYPES

Used during Combat Configuration (Step 2) & Hit Allocation (Step 7).

* **Beam Frigate:** Counters Shield Cruiser, Drone Carrier. Countered by Artillery Platform, Fighter Squadron.
* **Shield Cruiser:** Counters Fighter Squadron, Artillery Platform. Countered by Beam Frigate, Drone Carrier.
* **Artillery Platform:** Counters Drone Carrier, Beam Frigate. Countered by Shield Cruiser, Fighter Squadron.
* **Drone Carrier:** Counters Fighter Squadron, Shield Cruiser. Countered by Beam Frigate, Artillery Platform.
* **Fighter Squadron:** Counters Beam Frigate, Artillery Platform. Countered by Shield Cruiser, Drone Carrier.

## 11. OBJECTIVE CARDS & CLAIMING

Five public cards offer VP. *(Note: Specific conditions on cards may be complex; refer to card text. These might be simplified based on playtesting.)*

* **Claiming:** During your turn (Phase 2, Step 7), if you meet the condition for an unclaimed VP slot on a card, you *may* place your Claim Marker there.
* **Limit:** Max 1 claim per turn. Claim immediately for "This Turn" conditions.
* **Game End Trigger:** Claiming the very last VP slot across all 5 cards ends the game.

## 12. STRUCTURES

Structures are unique installations built via the **Build Action** (Section 8.C) that provide ongoing benefits and Victory Points.

**General Rules:**

* **Placement:** Must be placed in a sector you **control**.
* **Uniqueness:** A sector cannot contain more than one structure token *of the same type* from the same player (Exception: see Outpost). You cannot build in a sector already containing an opponent's structure (though you might destroy theirs first!).
* **Player Limits:** Each player may have a maximum of: 2 Outposts, 1 Starlance, 1 Hypergate, 1 M-Brain built on the map at any time.
* **Combat Relevance:** If combat ends in mutual destruction, the sector becomes uncontrolled, UNLESS the original Defender had *any* structure present in the sector before combat began. In that specific case, the Defender retains control.

**Structure List:**

| Structure | Blue Cost | Orange Cost | VP | Max per Player | Effect                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------- | :-------- | :---------- | :- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Outpost** | 1         | 3           | 2  | 2              | When performing the Build Action to build Fleets **in the sector containing this Outpost**, reduce the Orange cost per fleet built *there* by 1 (to min 0).        |
| **Starlance** | 1         | 4           | 2  | 1              | Enables the **Target Structure** action: Once per turn, as your *entire* Attack Action, pay **3 Red** resources to remove one enemy Structure token from an adjacent sector. |
| **Hypergate** | 2         | 6           | 2  | 1              | During your **Move Action**, treat sectors containing your Hypergates as adjacent. Moving between two Hypergate sectors costs 1 base move distance.                 |
| **M-Brain** | 4         | 7           | 3  | 1              | Allows repeating the main Core Action on consecutive turns. Reduce Protocol activation cost by 1 (to min 0).                                                      |

## 13. DIRECTIVE & PROTOCOL RULES

Three public pairs offer bonus actions.

* **Tiers:** Directive (1 Easy, 2 Med, 3 Hard), Protocol (1 Cheap, 2 Mid, 3 Expensive).
* **Display:** Pairs (Directive 1 / Protocol 3), (Directive 2 / Protocol 2), (Directive 3 / Protocol 1) visible. Draw/discard from tiered decks above/below.
* **Activation:** See Turn Structure (Phase 2, Step 5). Requires **Pattern Matching** (see Glossary) at intersection adjacent to your controlled sector. Bonus Protocol action must differ from Main Action. Pay Protocol cost + Action cost. Limit 1 per turn.
* **Master Influence:** Master refreshes one card or pair each round (Phase 1, Step 2).

## 14. END OF GAME

Game ends **immediately** when:

1. **Grid Completion:** Last Sector Card placed & paid for. (+5 VP to exploring player).
2. **Objective Completion:** Last VP slot on any Public Objective Card claimed.

Proceed immediately to Scoring.

## 15. SCORING

Calculate final VP:

1. **Grid Bonus:** +5 VP if you placed the last Sector Card.
2. **Controlled Sectors:** +1 VP per sector you control.
3. **Structures:** VP per structure owned on map (Outpost/Starlance/Hypergate=2 VP, M-Brain=3 VP).
4. **Fleet Tokens:** +1 VP per 3 Fleet Tokens you have on map (round down).
5. **Economic Resources:** +1 VP per 1 **Orange** resource on Storage Card.
6. **Objective Cards:** VP value for each Objective slot you claimed.

**Winner:** Player with the most VP.
**Tiebreaker:** 1st: Most combined Blue + Red + Green resources. 2nd: Most Fleet Tokens on map.
