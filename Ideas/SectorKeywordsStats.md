A significant majority of cards feature two keywords, ensuring that players exploring and controlling territory will often gain exposure to multiple thematic categories simultaneously. This distribution supports systems where access to specific game elements (like technology paths) is gated by controlling sectors with corresponding keywords, allowing for both strategic diversification and specialization.
