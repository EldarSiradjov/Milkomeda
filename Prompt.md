I am a Board game designer, this is my board Game with the working title Milkomeda. It is a lot to consider and i need to tackle designing it till its finished. I am looking for what specific thing to tackle next or even just keep the overview. Simplifying is also interesting to me. the game needs to be fast and fun and yet keep the complexity of a 4x euro with a luck factor in it.
